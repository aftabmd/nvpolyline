This is an example project demonstrating how to draw a polyline inside an
MKMapView that continues to display correctly even as a user pinches and zooms
the map. It incorporates and expands upon ideas from Craig Spitzkoff and
Nicolas Neubauer.

This solution is focused on iPhone OS versions < 4.0
In iPhone OS 4 the MKPolyline has been added. However this does not exist in earlier versions.

The original example from http://github.com/wlach contained some bugs, which did not seem to get fixed. Bugs fixed:
- Polyline View overlaps other Annotation Views (http://github.com/wlach/nvpolyline/issues#issue/2)
- App crashes when zoomed in (http://github.com/wlach/nvpolyline/issues#issue/1)
